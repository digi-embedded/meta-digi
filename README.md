# Known Issues and Limitations

This is a list of known issues and limitations at the time of release. An
updated list can be found on the online documentation.

* Firmware update
  * The software update package must be located in the root level of the
    update media (subfolders are not yet supported).
* Cloud Connector
  * Remote file system management fails with long file names and paths
    (over 255 characters).
* Wireless
  * Performance of the wireless interface is reduced when using concurrent mode,
    as the wireless interface is shared between several different
    functionalities.
  * When using wireless concurrent mode, Digi recommends you keep the different
    modes on the same frequency channels. For example, when configuring access
    point mode on channel 36 in the 5GHz band, connect to the same channel both
    in station mode and Wi-Fi direct so that the radio performance is optimized.
  * When working as an access point, DFS-capable channels in the 5GHz band are
    not supported.
  * For P2P connections Digi recommends "Negotiated GO" modes. The QCA6564
    devices (ConnectCore 6UL, ConnectCore 6 Plus, and ConnectCore 8M Nano) fail
    to join autonomous groups.

## ConnectCore 8M Nano

* ConnectCore 8M Nano System-on-Module (SOM)
  * CPU wake-up sources are not yet supported

## ConnectCore 8X

* i.MX8QXP Processor
  * GPU maximum performance reduced. The maximum frequency targets are 850 MHz
    for the shaders and 700 MHz for the core. However, in this hardware release
    the maximum frequency is limited to 650 MHz for the shaders and 600 MHz for
    the core, with the corresponding performance reduction. These targets will
    be met in future releases of the hardware.
  * BSDL operation is not supported. It will be available in future releases
    of the hardware.

## ConnectCore 6UL

* ConnectCore 6UL System-on-Module (SOM)
  * The UART connected to the Bluetooth chip on early versions of the ConnectCore
    6UL system-on-module (hardware version < 4) cannot properly execute flow
    control. To work around this issue, UART1 of these SOM versions has been
    configured to operate at 115200 bps and without hardware flow control,
    reducing the maximum throughput of this interface.
  * The QCA6564 wireless chip does not support Wake On Wireless LAN.

## ConnectCore 6 Plus

* ConnectCore 6 Plus System-on-Module (SOM)
  * NXP i.MX6QP processor has a documented errata (ERR004512) whereby the maximum
    performance of the Gigabit FEC is limited to 400Mbps (total for Tx and Rx).
* ConnectCore 6 Plus SBC
  * The Micrel PHY KSZ9031 may take between five and six seconds to
    auto-negotiate with Gigabit switches.

## ConnectCore 6

* ConnectCore 6 System-on-Module (SOM)
  * NXP i.MX6 processor has a documented errata (ERR004512) whereby the maximum
    performance of the Gigabit FEC is limited to 400Mbps (total for Tx and Rx).
  * When using softAP mode on Band A on the Qualcomm AR6233, channels used for
    Dynamic Frequency Selection (DFS) are not supported.
  * The Qualcomm AR6233 firmware does not support the following configuration
    modes:
    * Concurrent modes involving P2P mode, such as P2P + softAP or P2P + STA.
    * Bluetooth + softAP + STA concurrent mode.
  * A maximum of five clients are supported when using Qualcomm's AR6233 in
    softAP mode.
  * A maximum of ten connected devices are supported when using Qualcomm's AR6233
    Bluetooth Low Energy mode.
* ConnectCore 6 SBC
  * The Micrel PHY KSZ9031 may take between five and six seconds to
    auto-negotiate with Gigabit switches.
