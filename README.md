# Known Issues and Limitations

This is a list of known issues and limitations at the time of release. An
updated list can be found on the online documentation.

* Firmware update
  * The software update package must be located in the root level of the
    update media (subfolders are not yet supported).
* Cloud Connector
  * Remote file system management fails with long file names and paths
    (over 255 characters).
* Wireless
  * Performance of the wireless interface is reduced when using concurrent mode,
    as the wireless interface is shared between several different
    functionalities.
  * When using wireless concurrent mode, Digi recommends you keep the different
    modes on the same frequency channels. For example, when configuring access
    point mode on channel 36 in the 5GHz band, connect to the same channel both
    in station mode and Wi-Fi direct so that the radio performance is optimized.
  * When working as an access point, DFS-capable channels in the 5GHz band are
    not supported.
  * For P2P connections Digi recommends "Negotiated GO" modes. The QCA6564
    devices (ConnectCore 6UL, ConnectCore 6 Plus, and ConnectCore 8M Nano) fail
    to join autonomous groups.

## ConnectCore MP15/MP13

* ConnectCore MP1 System-on-Module (SOM)
  * Wireless
    * P2P on the ConnectCore MP1 doesn't currently work in concurrency with
      other modes (station or SoftAP).

## ConnectCore 6UL

* ConnectCore 6UL System-on-Module (SOM)
  * The UART connected to the Bluetooth chip on early versions of the ConnectCore
    6UL system-on-module (hardware version < 4) cannot properly execute flow
    control. To work around this issue, UART1 of these SOM versions has been
    configured to operate at 115200 bps and without hardware flow control,
    reducing the maximum throughput of this interface.
  * The QCA6564 wireless chip does not support Wake On Wireless LAN.
