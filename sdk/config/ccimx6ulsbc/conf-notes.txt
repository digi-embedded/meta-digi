Digi Embedded Yocto provides the following image recipes:

  * dey-image-qt: graphical QT image

    By default the image is X11-based so it provides a full SATO theme
    desktop environment.

  * core-image-base: a console-only image

    Expansion of native core-image-base by including all the support for the
    target device hardware like firmware files, rootfs customizations, etc.

  * dey-image-aws: console-only image supporting Amazon Web Services IoT

    This image includes the AWS Greengrass Core and an AWS IoT platform
    example application. For more information on AWS support in Digi
    Embedded Yocto see the online documentation.
