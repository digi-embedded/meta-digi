# By default, ModemManager expects a default baudrate of 57600bps. Different
# baudrates may be used by setting the ID_MM_TTY_BAUDRATE udev tag.

# ModemManager documentation states that the best practice is to use the DEVPATH
# this way rather than other rules such as KERNEL, so be careful when modifying
