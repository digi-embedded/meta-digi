Subject: [PATCH 35/49] nl80211: Set NL80211_SCAN_FLAG_COLOCATED_6GHZ in scan

Set NL80211_SCAN_FLAG_COLOCATED_6GHZ in the scan parameters to enable
scanning for co-located APs discovered based on neighbor reports from
the 2.4/5 GHz bands when not scanning passively. Do so only when
collocated scanning is not disabled by higher layer logic.
